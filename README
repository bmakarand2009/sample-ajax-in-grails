This Sample AJAX Application Has two problems that need to be resolved

1. When I delete the Contact , the contact still shows in the list, until I refresh the page or click on delete again

   I am very much thankful to Jeff Brown, he solved this problem in minutes by doing flush while deleting the contact.
   I wasted countless hours figuring it out.


2. Create contact uses g:formRemote, to submit the data and it works great, Question is if there is an error
   how do we bounce back it to the user.
   As on completion we need to hide the contact form
